# 8-bit-Four-Function-Calculator

### Description
The 8-bit calculator implementation includes the application of  real time memory access, a seven-segment display, and higher-level math operations such as multiplication and division. The system consists of 4 major blocks, an ALU, SRAM blocks, a binary to BCD converter, and a seven-segment display. The system begins with the 16 DIP switch values flowing into each of the math operations where arithmetic is performed on two 8-bit values. The result of each operation is routed to a four by one multiplexer. When the user presses the button of the operation they want to perform a 2-bit operation code is assigned to direct the mux to select the result of the desired math operation. The operation code is the same address used to read/write information from memory. The output of the ALU is then written to the corresponding address in memory. After memory has been written to it is then read from by the binary to BCD converter where the math result in binary is converted to a decimal value in binary. The seven-segment display then receives the output of the conversion and displays the answer to the user in decimal form.
